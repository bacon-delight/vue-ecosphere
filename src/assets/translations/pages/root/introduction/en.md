A modern lightweight design system, built on the principles of minimalism with inspirations from Scandinavian architecture, handcrafted for data intensive applications

#### Principles

At the heart of Ecosphere is a focus on simplicity. The system has been stripped down to its most essential elements, resulting in a design that is clean, simple, and easy to use. This minimalist approach ensures that users can navigate through the system with ease, without being overwhelmed by unnecessary features or cluttered interfaces.

In addition to its minimalist design, Ecosphere is also highly customisable. Users can easily customise the design system with its easy-to-use APIs to fit their unique needs and preferences, allowing them to create a truly personalised experience. The design system has been handcrafted with meticulous attention to detail. Every element has been carefully considered to ensure that it delivers an exceptional user experience. From the typography to the colour palette, every aspect of the design has been optimised to ensure that it looks and feels amazing.
