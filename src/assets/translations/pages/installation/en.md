Install the plugin in a new or an existing Vue application

```sh
npm install vue-ecosphere
```

Import the installed plugin in `main.js`

```js
import Ecosphere from "vue-ecosphere";
app.use(Ecosphere);
```

That's it, you're done with the installation and setup of Ecosphere! You can now use all the components and access the `$ecosphere` global property from anywhere within your application.

To learn more about the global property and related configurations, view the [Configuration](/guide/configuration) section.
